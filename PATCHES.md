This module modifies and extends the vision and detection mode API.

- Separates the light perception part of Basic Sight into a separate mode to allow control over the range of light perception.
- Adds the possibility of imprecise detection modes that merely reveal the location and size of the token but nothing else.
- Each vision mode is linked to a detection mode that becomes the primary detection mode when it is active.
